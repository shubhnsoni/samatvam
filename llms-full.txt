# Samatvam Living — Complete Information

> Holistic coaching for the modern leader. We build frameworks that make healthy habits easier to execute in real life.

## Company Overview

Samatvam Living is a wellness coaching company specializing in holistic health transformation for busy professionals and corporate teams. The name "Samatvam" comes from Sanskrit, meaning equanimity or balance — reflecting our philosophy that true wellness comes from finding equilibrium across all aspects of life.

Our coaching is evidence-based, combining modern sports science, nutritional science, and behavioral psychology with practical frameworks that integrate into demanding lifestyles.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What makes Samatvam different from other wellness programs?**
A: We focus on building sustainable systems, not quick fixes. Our three-pillar framework (Restore, Nourish, Move) addresses root causes rather than symptoms. We don't prescribe one-size-fits-all solutions — every plan is adapted to your real life.

**Q: Do I need to be in a specific location?**
A: No. All our coaching is available online. We work with clients globally across time zones.

**Q: How long does it take to see results?**
A: Most clients notice improved energy and sleep within the first 2 weeks. Significant body composition and habit changes typically happen within 8-12 weeks. Sustainable lifestyle transformation is a 6-12 month journey.

**Q: Is this only for people who want to lose weight?**
A: No. While weight management is a common goal, our programs address energy, stress, sleep quality, mental clarity, athletic performance, and overall vitality.

**Q: Do you offer corporate packages?**
A: Yes. We offer workshops, team challenges, and ongoing corporate wellness programs tailored to your organization's needs and budget.

**Q: What if I have dietary restrictions or health conditions?**
A: Our coaching is adaptable. We work with vegetarians, vegans, people with food allergies, and those managing conditions like PCOS, thyroid issues, or diabetes. We always recommend working alongside your healthcare provider.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Pricing varies by program. Visit our programs page or contact us for current pricing. We offer different tiers to fit various budgets.

**Q: Can I try before committing?**
A: Yes. We offer discovery calls where you can learn about our approach and see if it's the right fit. The 14-Day Masterclass is also a great low-commitment starting point.
