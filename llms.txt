# Samatvam Living

> Holistic coaching for the modern leader. We build frameworks that make healthy habits easier to execute in real life.

## About

Samatvam Living is a wellness coaching company that helps busy professionals transform their health through sustainable, science-backed frameworks. Our approach is built on three pillars: Restore (sleep, stress, recovery), Nourish (nutrition, hydration, gut health), and Move (movement, mobility, strength).

We believe that wellness isn't about perfection — it's about building systems that work within your real life. Our programs are designed for people who are high-performing but struggling with energy, weight, stress, or burnout.

No. All our coaching is available online. We work with clients globally.

**How long does it take to see results?**
Most clients notice improved energy and sleep within the first 2 weeks. Significant body composition and habit changes typically happen within 8-12 weeks.
